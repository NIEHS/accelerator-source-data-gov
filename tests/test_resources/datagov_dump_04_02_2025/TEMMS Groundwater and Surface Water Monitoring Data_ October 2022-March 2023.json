    "notes": "The data compiled in this file were collected at the Theis-Nash Environmental Monitoring and Modeling Site managed by the University of Cincinnati.  The monitoring network consisted of ten shallow piezometers installed in a compound bar within the Great Miami River.  A stilling well was also installed within the river channel to monitor surface water stage.  These locations were instrumented with logging pressure transducers and STIC loggers to collect a continuous record of water elevation, temperature, and specific conductance.  Pressure data were converted to absolute elevation based on manual depth to water measurements from surveyed reference locations at the top of piezometer casings and stilling well support post.  STIC relative conductivity readings were converted to specific conductance using calibration relationships developed for each logger prior to deployment and subsequent benchmarking to manual measurements of specific conductance within the piezometers and the river conducted during the deployment period.  Data from the transducers and STIC sensors were acquired during the period from October 2022 to March 2023; manual measurements were conducted during periods of low stage when the compound bar was exposed within the river channel. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMcGarr, J.T., P.
