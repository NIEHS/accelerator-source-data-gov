    "notes": "Soil investigation in the Riverpark subdivision took place over several phases. This feature class contains final grade samples taken in Phases III and IV. Resource Concepts, Inc. conducted the soil sampling on behalf of the developer Lennar Homes. All final reports were transmitted to NDEP.\n\nEach lot was sampled at two locations: one in the front yard and one in the back yard. One of the samples represented soils from 0 -1 foot below grade (fbg), and the other represented soils from 1- 2 fbg. Samples for each unit were taken over a span of several days. Sample date provided in the attribute table lists the final date of sampling. Sample date ranges for each unit are listed below:\n\nPhase III\nUnit 8: Samples were collected on December 28, 2004.\nUnit 11: Samples were collected between March 1 and March 6, 2006.\nUnit 12: Samples were collected between March 7 and March 9, 2006.\nUnit 13: Samples were collected between March 6 and March 15, 2006.\nUnit 14: Samples were collected on March 20, March 23, and March 24, 2006.\nUnit 15: Samples were collected between August 22 and August 28, 2006.\n\nPhase IV\nUnit 1: Samples were collected on October 10 and October 11, 2006.\nUnit 2: Samples were collected on October 25 and October 26, 2006.\nUnit 3: Samples were collected on April 3 and April 5, 2007.\nUnit 4: Samples were collected on November 28 and November 29, 2006.\n\nAll samples were surveyed in the field using a Trimble 5800 survey-grade GPS receiver tied into centerline monuments. All sample results below the 0.05 mg/kg detection limit are recorded as ND (Non-Detectable).\n\nSample locations were mapped by digitizing the original hardcopy of the following report figures:\n\nFigure 1-A, Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 1(Summit Engineering Corp., modified October 9, 2006), Figure 2-A Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 2(Summit Engineering Corp., modified October 9, 2006),Figure 3-A Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 3(Summit Engineering Corp., modified May 22, 2007),\n\nFigure 4- A, Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 4 (Summit Engineering Corp., modified November 27, 2006).\n\nFigure 8A, Final Subdivision for Riverpark Unit 8 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants, modified April 21, 2006); Figure 8B Final Subdivision for Riverpark Unit 8 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants, modified April 21, 2006); Final Subdivision for Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 13 (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 7, 2006) and Final Subdivision for Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 14 (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 9, 2006).\n\nFigure 11-A Revised, Final Subdivision Plat for Riverpark Unit 11 ( TEC Civil Engineering Consultants., modified March 29, 2006);\n\nFigure 12-A Revised, Final Subdivision Plat for Riverpark Unit 12 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants., modified March 29, 2006).\n\nFigure 13-A, Final Map of Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 13 for Riverpark Properties, LLC (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 29, 2006),\n\nFigure 15-A, Final Map of Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 15 for Riverpark Properties, LLC (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 8, 2006).\n\nThese figures include the note \"Sample site locations are approximate relative to lot lines in this figure.\" Georeferencing of the sample locations included matching significant landmarks identified on the figures contained in the report to the CRMS geodatabase base map and current Lyon County Assessor\u00e2??s parcel map.\n\nReport figures and more information on field sampling procedures can be found in the following source documents:\n\nResource Concepts, Inc., Robin A.
