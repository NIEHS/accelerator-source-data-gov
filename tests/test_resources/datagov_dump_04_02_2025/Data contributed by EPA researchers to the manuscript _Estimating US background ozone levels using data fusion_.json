The horizontal and vertical extent of the 36 km modeling domain was specified by the external collaborator and was defined by 524 boundary grid cells and 34 vertical layers.

Two of these simulations were performed over the northern hemisphere at a horizontal resolution of 108 km and the other two simulations were performed over the CONUS at a horizontal resolution of 12 km. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: The size of the data provided to the external researchers (>1TB) exceeds ScienceHub limits. It can be accessed through the following means: Data can be requested by contacting hogrefe.christian@epa.gov (EPA/ORD/CEMM-contributed dataset) and henderson.barron@epa.gov (EPA/OAR/OAQPS-contributed dataset) and providing an external hard to which the data can then be copied by staff at the National Computing Center. \r\n\r\nThe model simulations are stored on the /asm archival system accessible through the atmos high-performance computing (HPC) system.  Due to data management policies, files on /asm are subject to expiry depending on the template of the project. Files not requested for extension after the expiry date are deleted permanently from the system. \r\n\r\nLocation of EPA/ORD/CEMM-provided CMAQ model output data on asm:\r\n\u2022\t/asm/grc/NRT_WRF_CMAQ/model_outputs/nhemi108/cctm.conc\r\n\u2022\t/asm/MOD3EVAL/css/NRT/data/gatech/bc\r\n\u2022\t/asm/MOD3EVAL/css/NRT/data/gatech/scripts\r\n\u2022\t/asm/MOD3EVAL/css/NRT/data/gatech/metbdy3d\r\n\r\nLocation of EPA/OAR/OAQPS-provided CMAQ model output data on asm:\r\n\u2022\t/asm/ROMO/global/CMAQv5.2/2016fe_hemi_cb6_16jh/108km/output\r\n\u2022\t/asm/ROMO/global/CMAQv5.2.1/2016fe_hemi_cb6_16jh/108km/ZUSA/output\r\n\u2022\t/asm/ROMO/2016platform/CMAQv521/2016fe_cb6r3_ae6nvpoa_16j/12US2/output\r\n\u2022\t/asm/ROMO/2016platform/CMAQv521/2016fe_zusa_cb6r3_ae6nvpoa_16j/12US2/output.
