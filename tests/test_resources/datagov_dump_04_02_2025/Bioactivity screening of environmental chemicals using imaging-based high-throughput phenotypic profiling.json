    "notes": "In the present study, we adapted an existing phenotypic profiling assay (\u201cCell Painting\u201d, (Bray et al., 2016)) to be compatible with in-house microfluidics capabilities for 384-well culture format, chemical exposures and fluorescent cytochemistry in order to facilitate concentration-response screening of several hundred environmental chemicals. In this assay, human-derived cells were labeled with multiple fluorescent probes to visualize various subcellular organelles and structural features. High content image analysis workflows were used to measure hundreds of morphological features at the level of the individual cell (i.e. shape of the cells, intensity, texture and distribution of fluorescent labels, etc.). The resultant data were then used to calculate well-level summary values, perform high-throughput concentration-response modeling and generate phenotypic response profiles. First, we identified and screened a set of candidate phenotypic reference chemicals for use as plate-based controls for evaluating HTPP assay performance during large-scale screening studies and identified an optimal exposure duration for HTPP screening. Second, we screened a set of 462 environmental chemicals in the U-2 OS cell model and derived in vitro potency estimates for bioactivity of all active chemicals. In addition, we demonstrated the technical reproducibility of the HTPP assay in concentration-response screening mode using the previously identified phenotypic reference chemicals. Next, we used reverse dosimetry to calculate administered equivalent doses (AEDs) corresponding to the thresholds for chemical bioactivity and compared those values to in vivo effect values from mammalian toxicity studies. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNyffeler, J., C.
