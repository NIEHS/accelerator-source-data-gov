    "notes": "The EPA Recovery Mapper is an Internet interactive mapping application that allows users to discover information about every American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) award that EPA has funded for six programs. By integrating data reported by the recipients of Recovery Act funding and data created by EPA, this application delivers a level of transparency and public accessibility to users interested in EPA's use of Recovery Act monies. The application is relatively easy to use and builds on the same mapping model as Google, Bing, MapQuest and other commonly used mapping interfaces. EPA Recovery Mapper tracks each award made by each program and gives basic Quick Facts information for each award including award name, location, award date, dollar amounts and more. Data Summaries for each EPA program or for each state are provided displaying dollars for Total Awarded, Total Received (Paid), and Total Jobs This Quarter by Recovery for the latest quarter of data released by Recovery.gov. The data are reported to the government and EPA four times a year by the award recipients. The latest quarterly report will always be displayed in the EPA Recovery Mapper. In addition, the application provides many details about each award. Users will learn more about how to access and interpret these data later in this document. Data shown in the EPA Recovery Mapper are derived from information reported back to FederalReporting.gov from the recipients of Recovery Act funding. EPA reviews the recipient reported data and works with the recipients to correct the data when errors are found. Please note that the dollar amounts displayed at Recovery.gov may differ somewhat from the amounts in this application because EPA Recovery Mapper includes awards that EPA has funded for Superfund sites cleanups that were awarded by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Also, EPA Recovery Mapper also does not display awards for management and oversight and awards made to EPA's Inspector General which account for less than 1.4% of the Recovery Act funding that EPA has received.",
