    "notes": "Intraspecific variation in host infectiousness affects disease transmission dynamics in human, domestic animal, and many wildlife host-pathogen systems including avian influenza virus (AIV); therefore, identifying host factors related to host infectiousness is important for understanding, controlling, and preventing future outbreaks. Toward this goal, we used RNA-seq data collected from low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV)-infected blue-winged teal (Spatula discors) to determine the association between host gene expression and intraspecific variation in cloacal viral shedding magnitude, the transmissible fraction of virus. We found that host genes were differentially expressed between LPAIV-infected and uninfected birds early in the infection, host genes were differentially expressed between shed level groups at one-, three-, and five-days post-infection, host gene expression was associated with LPAIV infection patterns over time, and genes of the innate immune system had a positive linear relationship with cloacal viral shedding. This study provides important insights into host gene expression patterns associated with intraspecific LPAIV shedding variation and can serve as a foundation for future studies focused on the identification of host factors that drive or permit the emergence of high viral shedding individuals. Citation information for this dataset can be found in Data.gov's References section.",
