    "notes": "Background: Adverse cardiovascular events have been linked with PM2.5 exposure obtained primarily from air\nquality monitors, which rarely co-locate with participant residences. Modeled PM2.5 predictions at finer resolution\nmay more accurately predict residential exposure; however few studies have compared results across\ndifferent exposure assessment methods.\nMethods: We utilized a cohort of 5679 patients who had undergone a cardiac catheterization between\n2002\u20132009 and resided in NC. Exposure to PM2.5 for the year prior to catheterization was estimated using data\nfrom air quality monitors (AQS), Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) fused models at the census tract and\n12 km spatial resolutions, and satellite-based models at 10 km and 1 km resolutions. Case status was either a\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) index>23 or a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Logistic regression was used to\nmodel odds of having CAD or an MI with each 1-unit (\u03bcg/m3) increase in PM2.5, adjusting for sex, race, smoking\nstatus, socioeconomic status, and urban/rural status.\nResults: We found that the elevated odds for CAD>23 and MI were nearly equivalent for all exposure assessment\nmethods. One difference was that data from AQS and the census tract CMAQ showed a rural/urban difference\nin relative risk, which was not apparent with the satellite or 12 km-CMAQ models.\nConclusions: Long-term air pollution exposure was associated with coronary artery disease for both modeled and\nmonitored data.

This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access.

Format: There are two types of datasets used in this study:  clinical data taken from patient records at the Duke Medical Center; and air pollution data (PM2.5) taken from a federal reference monitor located in Raleigh, CMAQ data obtained from collaborators at Georgia Tech and NERL/ORD, and satellite data obtained from collaborators at Harvard.  \r\n\r\nMetadata are in the form of Excel spreadsheets that contain columns of data that specify clinical and exposure information for each individual participating in the study. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMcGuinn, L., C.
