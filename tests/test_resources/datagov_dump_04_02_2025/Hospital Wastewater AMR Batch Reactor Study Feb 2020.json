    "notes": "Two sets of triplicate SBRs were operated for ~three months in three-liter glass beakers with an active volume of two liters in a temperature controlled room, as described in Maile-Moskowitz et al.37 The SBRs were operated on a 12-hour cycle with a two-day hydraulic retention time and five-day solids retention time. Each cycle consisted of a 10.78\u2009h aeration period, including a 60-minute feed, followed by 8\u2009minutes of solids wasting (decanting of AS), 53\u2009minutes of solids settling, and a 12-minute effluent decant. During the aeration/react period the SBRs were aerated using Top Fin\u00ae Aquarium Air Pumps and mixed using stir plates. SBRs were fed and decanted using three- or four-roller peristaltic Masterflex\u00ae EasyLoad pump heads controlled by Masterflex\u00ae pump drives (Model 7553-80). Influent feed was obtained from a small, local Virginia WWTP (average flow of 3 million gallons per day), while hospital sewage was obtained from an urban medical centre in Chicago, Illinois. Untreated hospital sewage was collected from manholes over a 24-hour period and shipped to the Virginia Tech lab on ice. Upon arrival, hospital sewage was stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 56 days prior to commencing the experiment. We were unable to obtain fresh hospital sewage prior to the commencement of the dosing as the experiment occurred in February 2020, just before global COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were emplaced. After reaching steady-state, SBRs were maintained for 17 days post-hospital sewage addition. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nL. Brown, C., A. Maile-Moskowitz, A. J.
