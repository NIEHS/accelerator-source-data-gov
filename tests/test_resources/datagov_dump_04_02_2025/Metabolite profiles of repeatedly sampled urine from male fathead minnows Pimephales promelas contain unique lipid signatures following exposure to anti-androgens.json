    "notes": "The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we sought to identify candidate markers of exposure to antiandrogens\r\nby analyzing endogenous metabolite profiles in the urine of male fathead minnows (mFHM,\r\nPimephales promelas). Based on earlier work, we hypothesized that unidentified lipids in the urine of mFHM\r\nwere selectively responsive to exposure to androgen receptor antagonists,which is otherwise difficult to confirm\r\nusing established fish toxicity assays. A second goal was to evaluate the feasibility of non-lethally and repeatedly\r\nsampling urine from individual mFHMs over the time course of response to a chemical exposure. Accordingly, we\r\nexposed mFHM to the model anti-androgens vinclozolin or flutamide. Urine was collected from each fish at\r\n48 hour intervals over the course of a 14 day exposure. Parallel experiments were conducted with mFHM exposed\r\nto bisphenol A or control water. The frequent handling/sampling regime did not cause apparent adverse\r\neffects on the fish. Endogenous metabolite profiling was conducted with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\r\n(GC\u2013MS), which exhibited lower variation for the urinary metabolome than was found in earlier work with\r\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Specifically, for inter- and intra-individual variations, the median\r\nspectrum-wide relative standard deviation (RSD) was 32.6% and 33.3%, respectively, for GC\u2013MS analysis of\r\nurine from unexposed mFHM. These results compared favorably with similar measurements of urine from other\r\nmodel species, including the Sprague Dawley rat. In addition, GC\u2013MS allowed us to identify several lipids\r\n(e.g., certain saturated fatty acids) in mFHM urine as candidate markers of exposure to androgen receptor\r\nantagonists.\r\nThe dataset that is uploaded here is the complete processed data from GC-MS instrument. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nCollette , T., D.
