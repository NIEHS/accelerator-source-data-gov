    "notes": "This is a manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal publication of some of the data of the project on \u201cEvaluation of Analytical Methods for Detection of Bacillus anthracis Surrogate Spores: Compatibility with Real-World Maritime Environmental Samples Collected from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Assets and Facilities\u201d, executed under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funded Analysis for Coastal Operational Resiliency (AnCOR) program to help the USCG in their efforts to be better prepared to respond to bioterrorism incidents. The manuscript presents the data on the evaluation of performance of the traditional culture (TC) and the rapid viability-polymerase chain reaction (RV-PCR) methods for compatibility with detection of spores of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk), a surrogate for the anthrax causing Bacillus anthracis, in maritime environmental surface and grab samples. Employing the commonly used surface sampling tools such as Sponge-Sticks and vacuum filter cassettes, samples containing background materials were collected from the response boat-small, response boat-medium, navigation computer screens on these boats, pier concrete, and wood surfaces at the USCG base in Portsmouth, VA. Also collected were grab samples (e.g., grass, gravel, boat wash-water). These samples were spiked in the laboratory with the spores of Bacillus thuringiensis which is commonly used as a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. The spiked samples were then processed to recover spores and analyzed by the two analytical methods. The performance of these methods was compared and is described in this manuscript. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNelson, S., K. Hofacre, M. Calfee, S. Serre, E.
