    "notes": "Data is CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality) air quality modeling data contained in 12km grids (covering the eastern US) and 36 km grids (covering the entire US) for the years 2004, 2005, and 2006. Each CMAQ grid contains a concentration value for an air pollutant (fine particulate matter - PM2.5), and this concentration value can be used to determine the impact of air pollution concentrations on hospital emergency department admissions for asthma, and hospital inpatient admissions for asthma, myocardial infraction (MI), and heart failure (HF) in Baltimore Maryland. CMAQ data is in both *.IOAPI (Input/Output Applications Programming Interface) format and *.csv (comma-separated value) format. Health data was used in this analysis, but the health data cannot be released because it contains personally identifiable information (PII) on living individuals, and is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) of 1996 (as amended), and is exempt from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The health dataset contains information about human research subjects, and access to it was limited by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) decision of 19 February 2014 (Protocol #13-76), and updated on 8 December 2016. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects.
