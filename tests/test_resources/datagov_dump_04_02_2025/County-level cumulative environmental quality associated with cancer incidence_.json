    "notes": "Population based cancer incidence rates were abstracted from National Cancer Institute,\nState Cancer Profiles for all available counties in the United States for which data were\navailable. This is a national county-level database of cancer data that are collected by state\npublic health surveillance systems. All-site cancer is defined as any type of cancer that is\ncaptured in the state registry data, though non-melanoma skin cancer is not included. All-site\nage-adjusted cancer incidence rates were abstracted separately for males and females.\nCounty-level annual age-adjusted all-site cancer incidence rates for years 2006\u20132010 were\navailable for 2687 of 3142 (85.5%) counties in the U.S. Counties for which there are fewer\nthan 16 reported cases in a specific area-sex-race category are suppressed to ensure\nconfidentiality and stability of rate estimates; this accounted for 14 counties in our study.\nTwo states, Kansas and Virginia, do not provide data because of state legislation and\nregulations which prohibit the release of county level data to outside entities. Data from\nMichigan does not include cases diagnosed in other states because data exchange\nagreements prohibit the release of data to third parties. Finally, state data is not available for\nthree states, Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington. The age-adjusted average annual\nincidence rate for all counties was 453.7 per 100,000 persons.\nWe selected 2006\u20132010 as it is subsequent in time to the EQI exposure data which was\nconstructed to represent the years 2000\u20132005. We also gathered data for the three leading\ncauses of cancer for males (lung, prostate, and colorectal) and females (lung, breast, and\ncolorectal). \n\nThe EQI was used as an exposure metric as an indicator of cumulative environmental\nexposures at the county-level representing the period 2000 to 2005. A complete description\nof the datasets used in the EQI are provided in Lobdell et al.  and methods used for index\nconstruction are described by Messer et al. The EQI was developed for the period 2000\u2013\n2005 because it was the time period for which the most recent data were available when\nindex construction was initiated. The EQI includes variables representing each of the\nenvironmental domains. The air domain includes 87 variables representing criteria and\nhazardous air pollutants. The water domain includes 80 variables representing overall water\nquality, general water contamination, recreational water quality, drinking water quality,\natmospheric deposition, drought, and chemical contamination. The land domain includes 26\nvariables representing agriculture, pesticides, contaminants, facilities, and radon. The built\ndomain includes 14 variables representing roads, highway/road safety, public transit\nbehavior, business environment, and subsidized housing environment. The\nsociodemographic environment includes 12 variables representing socioeconomics and\ncrime.

This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access.
