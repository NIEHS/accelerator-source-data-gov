    "notes": "The purpose of this work was to develop and validate a 48 V lithium-ion battery model for integration into EPA\u2019s ALPHA vehicle simulation model and that can also be used within Gamma Technologies, LLC (Westmont, IL) GT-DRIVE\u2122 vehicle simulations.  These vehicle models allow simulation of energy flows and CO2 emissions for mild hybrid electric vehicles over EPA regulatory drive cycles and during real-world driving.  The battery model is a standard equivalent circuit model with two-time constant resistance-capacitance (RC) blocks. Resistances and capacitances were calculated using test data from an 8 Ah, 0.4 kWh, 48 V (nominal) lithium-ion battery obtained from a Tier 1 automotive supplier, A123 Systems, and developed specifically for 48 V MHEV applications. The A123 Systems battery has 14 pouch-type lithium ion cells arranged in a 14 series and 1 parallel (14S1P) configuration. The RC battery model was validated using battery test data generated by a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system that simulated the impact of mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV) operation on the A123 systems 48 V battery pack over U.S. regulatory drive cycles. The HIL system matched charge and discharge data originally generated by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) during chassis dynamometer testing of a 2013 Chevy Malibu Eco 115 V MHEV. All validation testing was performed at the Battery Test Facility (BTF) at the U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The simulated battery voltages, currents, and state of charge (SOC) of the HIL tests were in good agreement with vehicle test data over a number of different drive cycles and excellent agreement was achieved between RC model simulations of the 48 V battery and HIL battery test data. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLee, S., J.
