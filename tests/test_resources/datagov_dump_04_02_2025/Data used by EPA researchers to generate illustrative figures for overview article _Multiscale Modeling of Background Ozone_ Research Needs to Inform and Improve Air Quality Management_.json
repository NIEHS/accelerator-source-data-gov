The first simulation was performed for July 1 \u2013 31 over a 12 km modeling domain covering the Western U.S. The simulation was configured with the Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) to estimate the contributions from 9 source categories to modeled ozone. ISAM source contributions for July 17 \u2013 31 averaged over all grid cells located in Colorado were used to generate the illustrative pie chart in the overview article. The second simulation was performed for October 1, 2013 \u2013 August 31, 2014 over a 108 km modeling domain covering the northern hemisphere. This simulation was also configured with ISAM to estimate the contributions from non-US anthropogenic sources, natural sources, stratospheric ozone, and other sources on ozone concentrations. Ozone ISAM results from this simulation were extracted along a boundary curtain of the 12 km modeling domain specified over the Western U.S. for the time period January 1, 2014 \u2013 July 31, 2014 and used to generate the illustrative time-height cross-sections in the overview article. \n\nThe EPA/OAR/OAQPS-generated dataset consisted of hourly gridded CMAQ output for surface ozone concentrations for the year 2016. The CMAQ simulations were performed over the northern hemisphere at a horizontal resolution of 108 km. NO2 and O3 data for July 2016 was extracted from these simulations generate the vertically-integrated column densities shown in the illustrative comparison to satellite-derived column densities.\n\nCMAQ Model Data\n\nThe data from the CMAQ model simulations used in this research effort are very large (several terabytes) and cannot be uploaded to ScienceHub due to size restrictions. The model simulations are stored on the /asm archival system accessible through the atmos high-performance computing (HPC) system.  Due to data management policies, files on /asm are subject to expiry depending on the template of the project. Files not requested for extension after the expiry date are deleted permanently from the system. The format of the files used in this analysis and listed below is ioapi/netcdf. Documentation of this format, including definitions of the geographical projection attributes contained in the file headers, are available at \nhttps://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/ \n\nDocumentation on the CMAQ model, including a description of the output file format and output model species can be found in the CMAQ documentation on the CMAQ GitHub site at\nhttps://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nHogrefe, C., B.
