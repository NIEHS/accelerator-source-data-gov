    "notes": "The effect of acidity and relative humidity on bulk isoprene aerosol parameters has been investigated in several studies, however few measurements have been conducted on individual aerosol compounds. The focus of this study has been the examination of the effect of acidity and relative humidity on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) chemical composition from isoprene photooxidation in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NOx). A detailed characterization of SOA at the molecular level was also investigated. Experiments were conducted in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber operated in flow mode. Based on a detailed analysis of mass spectra obtained from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of silylated derivatives in electron impact and chemical ionization modes, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry, and collision-induced dissociation in the negative ionization modes, we characterized not only typical isoprene products, but also new oxygenated compounds. A series of nitroxy-organosulfates (OS) were tentatively identified on the basis of high resolution mass spectra. Under acidic conditions, the major identified compounds include 2-methyltetrols (2MT), 2-methylglyceric acid (2MGA) and 2MT-OS. Other products identified include epoxydiols, mono- and dicarboxylic acids, other organic sulfates, and nitroxy- and nitrosoxy-OS. The contribution of SOA products from isoprene oxidation to PM2.5 was investigated by analysing ambient aerosol collected at rural sites in Poland. Methyltetrols, 2MGA and several organosulfates and nitroxy-OS were detected in both the field and laboratory samples. The influence of relative humidity on SOA formation was modest in non-acidic seed experiments, and stronger under acidic seed aerosol. Total secondary organic carbon decreased with increasing relative humidity under both acidic and non-acidic conditions. While the yields of some of the specific organic compounds decreased with increasing relative humidity others varied in an indeterminate manner from changes in the relative humidity. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNestorowicz, K., M.
