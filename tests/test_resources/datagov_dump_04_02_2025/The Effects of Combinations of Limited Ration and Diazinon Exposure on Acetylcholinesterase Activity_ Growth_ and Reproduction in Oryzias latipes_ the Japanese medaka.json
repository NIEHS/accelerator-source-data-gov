    "notes": "Environmental contamination can negatively impact fish populations. In addition to acute toxicity leading to death, toxicants can reduce fish growth and lower reproduction. The potential for adverse population level effects of environmental contaminants are estimated from laboratory toxicity tests that most often measure apical endpoints related to growth, survival, and reproduction. The relationships between these endpoints are being evaluated to better predict shifts in fish population demography after exposure to environmental toxicants. Environmental contaminants can also affect fish populations indirectly by reducing prey biomass. However, estimating the combined effects of prey reduction and direct toxicity is difficult and rarely attempted. Here we describe a toxicity test designed to estimate the effect on Japanese medaka of both reduced food and chronic exposure to diazinon, an acetylcholinesterase inhibiting organophosphate pesticide. Fish were reared with limited food ration and/or diazinon exposure through a full life-cycle to assess possible interactions between the two stressors in their effects on growth and reproduction. Diazinon exposure, reduced ration, or combinations of both lowered growth rates and reproductive output of Japanese medaka. Various relationships between the two stressors (diazinon and ration) and growth and reproduction were modeled. These results inform fish models being developed by EPA to predict population consequences of chemical exposures. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nFlynn, K., J.
