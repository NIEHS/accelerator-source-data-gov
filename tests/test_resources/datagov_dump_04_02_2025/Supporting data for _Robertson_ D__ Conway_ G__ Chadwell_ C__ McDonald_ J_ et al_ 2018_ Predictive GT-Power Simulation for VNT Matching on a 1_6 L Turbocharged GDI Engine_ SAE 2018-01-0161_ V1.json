    "notes": "Low-pressure loop exhaust gas recirculation (LP- EGR) combined with higher compression ratio, is a technology package that has been a focus of research to increase engine thermal efficiency of downsized, turbocharged gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines. Research shows that the addition of LP-EGR reduces the propensity to knock that is experienced at higher compression ratios [1]. To investigate the interaction and compatibility between increased compression ratio and LP-EGR, a 1.6 L Turbocharged GDI engine was modified to run with LP-EGR at a higher compression ratio (12:1 versus 10.5:1) via a piston change. This paper presents the results of the baseline testing on an engine run with a prototype controller and initially tuned to mimic an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) baseline control strategy running on premium fuel (92.8 anti-knock index). This paper then presents test results after first adding LP-EGR to the baseline engine, and then also increasing the compression ratio (CR) using 12:1 pistons. As a last step, the 10.5 CR engine with LP-EGR was run on regular fuel (87.7 anti-knock index) to verify that this configuration could be calibrated to maintain performance like the baseline engine running on premium fuel. To understand the effect of each technology and operating strategy combination on vehicle fuel economy, the various engine maps were compared in EPA\u2019s Advanced Light-Duty Powertrain and Hybrid Analysis (ALPHA) tool over U.S. regulatory drive cycles. This work was done as part of the EPA's continuing assessment of advanced light-duty automotive technologies to support a Midterm Evaluation of Light-duty Vehicle GHG Standards. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMcDonald, J., J.
