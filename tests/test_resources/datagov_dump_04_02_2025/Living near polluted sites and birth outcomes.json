This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access. Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. It can be accessed through the following means: These data can be requested from the North Carolina State Center for Vital Statistics, Birth Defects Monitoring Program by experienced researchers with an approved IRB.\r\n\r\nInput data for polluted sites was downloaded from publicly available facility registries at the following links.  \r\nToxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites: https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present \r\nSuperfund sites: https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sems-search \r\nLandfill sites: https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/waste-management/solid-waste-section/solid-waste-facility-lists-presentations-and-annual-reports/solid-waste-facility-lists \r\nAuxiliary data from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) on specific contaminants: \r\nSubstance Priority List (SPL) (downloaded file for all past lists): https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/spl/resources/index.html.
