    "notes": "This feature class depicts the locations and analytical data for confirmation samples collected by Converse Consultants in 2006 within on the top 2 feet of soil at finish grade. These samples were intended to represent the potential exposure of residents after home construction and the sampling program and design was performed in accordance with guidelines of the draft LTSRP in effect at that time. The following resources were used in compiling this dataset: Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., January 5, 2006, Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1, Final Sampling Results, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C. Report describes the collection of 445 samples collected after completion of finish grade on the Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1 residential properties. The report states an additional 28 samples were collected and analyzed in this effort for quality assurance/quality control purposes. This report also briefly summarizes work performed in the 35 acre \u201cOld Pond\u201d area. The report includes a summary table of analytical results titled \u201cSanta (sic) Maria Ranch-Phase I Sampling at Final Lot Grade\u201d. Analytical results from this summary table were associated with the corresponding sample ID to the respective map location. Converse Consultants, drafted by KIB, December 23, 2005, Final Sample Locations, Figure No. 1, sample location plan accompanying January 5, 2006 report referenced above. Figure 1 shows proposed Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1 parcel boundaries, streets and open space. It also includes roughly 35 acres of contiguous land east of the residential development proposed to remain as open space. Figure 1 maps the locations of 445 sample locations described in the Final Sampling Results report. Sample locations were mapped by digitizing the original hardcopy Figure 1 and matching to significant landmarks in the CRMS geodatabase base map and current Lyon County Assessor\u2019s parcel map. Final samples were collected between March 2 and 15, 2005. The sample date in the attribute table refers to the final date of the sampling period. After final sampling completed, 10 additional lots were identified that required additional fill. Samples were collected in these lots on November 28 and 30, 2005.",
