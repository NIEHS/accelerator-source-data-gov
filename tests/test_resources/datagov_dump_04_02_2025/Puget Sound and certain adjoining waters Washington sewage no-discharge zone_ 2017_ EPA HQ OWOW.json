Agency uses include state base maps; landscape analyses and modeling; the Family Forest Fish Passage Program; landslide mapping; the Sustainable Harvest Calculation; fire protection; the Natural Heritage Program; and the Trust Forestland HCP water typing system. DNR HYDRO is also used for Forest Practices water typing. The dataset serves as the Forest Practices Water Type Map. The Forest Practices water typing system is used in the planning and regulation of forest practices on state and private forest land. Forest Practices water types (WAC 222-16-031) are intended for DNR Forest Practices regulatory purposes only.\nThe DNR water course (WC), water body (WB), and water shoreline (WS) datasets, collectively known as DNR HYDRO, make up the most up-to-date hydrography layer for the state of Washington. WC represents water courses as arcs or lines. These occur alone as single arcs representing streams, ditches, or pipelines, or as centerlines through water body polygons such as double-banked streams, lakes, impoundments, reservoirs, wet areas, or glaciers. WB represents water bodies as polygonal features. WB includes features such as Puget Sound, lakes, wet areas, reservoirs, impoundments, glaciers, islands, and dams. WS represents shorelines as polygon perimeter arcs. The WC and WBWS are edited daily and simultaneously; updates are posted weekly for internal DNR use and monthly for external use. Attribute interrelationships within the WC and within the WBWS and spatial and attribute interrelationships between the WC and WBWS are maintained. DNR HYDRO is continually updated through the DNR Forest Practices Water Type Modification Form process. DNR HYDRO is mixed scale. The nominal scale is considered 1:24,000, but some data at larger scales are included."
