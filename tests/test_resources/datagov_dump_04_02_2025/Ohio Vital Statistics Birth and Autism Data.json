Output data are all available in tabulated form within the published manuscript. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access. Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. It can be accessed through the following means: Input data can be obtained from Applications from owners of the data (Children's Hospital and Ohio Department of Health).  The tabulated output data is found in the manuscript. Format: Input datasets on Ohio Birth and Autism will not be made accessible to the public due to the fact that they include individual-level data with PII. Output data are all available in tabulated form within the published manuscript (e.g., results of regression models, measures of central tendency, population characteristics, etc.). \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nKaufman, J., M.
