    "notes": "This data set contains sociodemographic data on households and individuals who  participated in the study, behavioral data (recreational water contacts during the index beach visit and prior to it), and symptoms data from a follow-up survey as well as data on salivary antibody responses to selected waterborne pathogens. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access. Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. It can be accessed through the following means: The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on study participants but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. EPA cannot publicly release PII regarding living individuals according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. Format: This study was conducted in one town. The study datasets includes personal identifiers of study participants, such as sex, age, and race, as well as behavioral (recreational water contacts) and gastrointestinal symptoms data, and data on antibody responses to waterborne pathogens. Demographic data can be used to identify study participants residing in the specific community. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nEgorov, A., R. Converse, S. Griffin, R.
