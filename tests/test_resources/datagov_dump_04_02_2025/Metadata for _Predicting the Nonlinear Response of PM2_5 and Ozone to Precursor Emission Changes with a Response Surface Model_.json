    "notes": "The data for this project include fields that are output from the numerous CMAQ simulations used to build the RSM. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: The data is too large to be included on ScienceHub. It can be accessed through the following means: This data can be accessed by contacting the corresponding authors as will be noted by the peer-reviewed journal. Format: This data is generated by OAQPS and colleagues at Tsinghua university in China. The output data are stored and, if requested, provided in the format of NetCDF. It is stored and preserved on the Atmos high performance computing (HPC) system located at the National Computing Center (NCC). \r\n\r\nThe folder location for raw model data and post-processed data is: /asm1/ROMO.\r\nThe input data is located in the folder titled: /work/ROMO\r\n\r\nData will be copied to the backup automatic storage management (ASM) system after completion of the project to make room for working space on Atmos. This backup system is also located at the National Computing Center, fully accessible form EPA computers at all times and backed up daily or more frequently.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and credibility throughout the project, the model code will be appropriately commented to indicate the algorithmic functioning in a manner suitable for the general computer programmer. CMAQ source code will be stored on Github at www.github.com/USEPA/CMAQ on the branch labeled \u20185.3.2\u2019. All substantive evolution of the model code will be documented by comments within the code, and the date of the change will be recorded in the standard logs created by Git version control.\r\n\r\nProject documentation is available via https://www.epa.gov/scram",
