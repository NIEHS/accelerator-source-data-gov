    "notes": "The Grantee Compliance Database Comply App is a comprehensive database for summarizing a wide range of grant recipient related activities. In addition to providing an overview of award information related to each grantee recipient, this database also stores historical information related to the recipient's training activities, indirect cost rate negotiations, pre-award certifications, post award monitoring plans, as well as on-site review, off-site review, and technical assistance activities. All advanced monitoring activities must be recorded in the system with an attached report to count as part of the Grantee Compliance Assistance Initiative as outlined in EPA Order 5700.6. The database tracks information on planned and actual On-Site Evaluative, off-Site Evaluative and/or On-Site Technical Assistance Visits conducted by each Grants Management and Program Office in the Agency. The primary objective of this database is to provide accurate information to EPA staff in Headquarters, Regional Program, and Grants Management Offices regarding compliance activities that each Program and Grants Management Office performs or plans to perform during any given calendar year.",
