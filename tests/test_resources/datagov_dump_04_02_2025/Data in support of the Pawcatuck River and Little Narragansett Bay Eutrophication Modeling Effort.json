    "notes": "This data repository has been created to support Cashel et al. 2024 publication titled \u201cUsing Monitoring and Mechanistic Modeling to Improve Understanding of Eutrophication in a Shallow New England Estuary\u201d. This research served to explore the applicability of observed data and a dynamic, mechanistic fate and transport water quality model to assess eutrophication and hypoxia in the Pawcatuck River Estuary (New England, USA). Associated files include outputs from the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed HSPF model, atmospheric forcing functions, continuous and discrete observed data in the Pawcatuck River Estuary, and additional information used to support this research. Refer to Section 6 of the Supplementary Materials associated with this research paper for a description of the contents of each file. \n\nContinuous (15-min intervals) sonde data and grab samples were collected across several years with locations designed to capture longitudinal, vertical, and lateral spatial variation within the system. Observed data include: salinity (SAL, ppt), water temperature (WT, \u00b0C), depth (DEP, m), dissolved oxygen (DO, mg/L), chlorophyll a (chl a, \u03bcg/L as chl a), ammonium (NH4, \u03bcg/L as N), nitrate (NO3, \u03bcg/L as N), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP, \u03bcg/L as P), total nitrogen (TN, \u03bcg/L as N), total phosphorus (TP, \u03bcg/L as P), and total suspended solids (TSS, \u03bcg/L). \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nCashel, F.S., C.D. Knightes, C. Lupo, T. Iott, K. Streich, C.J. Conville, T.W. Bridges, and I. Dombroski.
