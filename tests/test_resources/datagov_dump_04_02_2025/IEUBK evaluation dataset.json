This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access. Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. It can be accessed through the following means: Publicly available data used for this evaluation are located at https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/risk/\r\nrecordisplay.cfm?deid=351563. Additional BHSS details are publicly available at\r\nhttps://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=1000195. Format: The data used for this evaluation were collected during routine BLL monitoring at the Bunker Hill Superfund (BHSS) site by the local Kellogg Idaho Panhandle Health District under the auspices of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ). IDEQ contracts with Alta Science and Engineering, Inc. for technical, scientific, and engineering services at the BHSS, including maintaining the blood Pb and environmental databases. Alta maintains these data in a confidential (coded) format that prevents the identification of the participants and their home locations. With permission of IDEQ, Alta staff used paired BHSS BLL and environmental media concentration data to evaluate the IEUBK model v2.0. Transfer of individual or confidential data from Alta to SRC and EPA was expressly prohibited. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBrown, J.
