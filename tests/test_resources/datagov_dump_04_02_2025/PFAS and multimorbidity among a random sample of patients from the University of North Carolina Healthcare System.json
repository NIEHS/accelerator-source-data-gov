    "notes": "This dataset contains electronic health records used to study associations between PFAS occurrence and multimorbidity in a random sample of UNC Healthcare system patients. The dataset contains the medical record number to uniquely identify each individual as well as information on PFAS occurrence at the zip code level, the zip code of residence for each individual, chronic disease diagnoses, patient demographics, and neighborhood socioeconomic information from the 2010 US Census. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access. Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. It can be accessed through the following means: Because this data has PII from electronic health records the data can only be accessed with an approved IRB application. Project analytic code is available at L:/PRIV/EPHD_CRB/Cavin/CARES/Project Analytic Code/Cavin Ward/PFAS Chronic Disease and Multimorbidity. Format: This data is formatted as a R dataframe and associated comma-delimited flat text file. The data has the medical record number to uniquely identify each individual (which also serves as the primary key for the dataset), as well as information on the occurrence of PFAS contamination at the zip code level, socioeconomic data at the census tract level from the 2010 US Census, demographics, and the presence of chronic disease as well as multimorbidity (the presence of two or more chronic diseases). \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nWard-Caviness, C., J. Moyer, A. Weaver, R. Devlin, and D. Diazsanchez. Associations between PFAS occurrence and multimorbidity as observed in an electronic health record cohort.   Environmental Epidemiology.
