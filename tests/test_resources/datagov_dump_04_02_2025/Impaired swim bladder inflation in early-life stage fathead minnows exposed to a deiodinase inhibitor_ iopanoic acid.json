    "notes": "The present study investigated whether inhibition of deiodinase, the enzyme which converts thyroxine (T4) to the more biologically-active form, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), would impact inflation of the posterior and/or anterior chamber of the swim bladder, processes previously demonstrated to be thyroid-hormone regulated.  Two experiments were conducted using a model deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid (IOP). In the first study, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos were exposed to 0.6, 1.9, or 6.0 mg IOP/L or control water in a flow-through system until reaching 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) at which time posterior swim bladder inflation was assessed.  To examine effects on anterior swim bladder inflation, a second study was conducted with 6 dpf larvae exposed to the same IOP concentrations until reaching 21 dpf.  Fish from both studies were sampled for T4/T3 measurements, gene transcription analyses, and thyroid histopathology.  In the embryo study, incidence and length of inflated posterior swim bladders were significantly reduced in the 6.0 mg/L treatment at 6 dpf.  Incidence of inflation and length of anterior swim bladder in larval fish were significantly reduced in all IOP treatments at 14 dpf, but inflation recovered by 18 dpf.  Throughout the larval study, whole body T4 concentrations were significantly increased and T3 concentrations were significantly decreased in all IOP treatments.  Consistent with hypothesized compensatory responses, significant up-regulation of deiodinase-2 mRNA was observed in the larval study, and down-regulation of thyroperoxidase mRNA was observed in all IOP treatments in both studies.  Taken together, these results support the hypothesized adverse outcome pathways linking inhibition of deiodinase activity to impaired swim bladder inflation. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nCavallin, J., G.
