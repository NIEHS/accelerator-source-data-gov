    "notes": "A major challenge in ecotoxicology is accurately and sufficiently measuring chemical exposures and biological effects given the presence of complex and dynamic contaminant mixtures in surface waters. It is impractical to quantify all chemicals in such matrices over space and time, and even if it were practical, concomitant biological effects would not be elucidated. Our study examined the performance of the Daphnia magna transcriptome to detect distinct responses across three water sources in Minnesota: laboratory (well) waters, wetland waters, and storm waters. Pyriproxyfen was included as a gene expression and male neonate production positive control to examine whether gene expression resulting from exposure to this well-studied juvenoid hormone analog can be detected in complex matrices. Laboratory-reared (<24 h) D. magna were exposed to a water source and/or pyriproxyfen for 16 days to monitor phenotypic changes or 96 h to examine gene expression responses using Illumina HiSeq 2500 (10 million reads per library, 50-bp paired end [2 \u00d7 50]). The results indicated that a unique gene expression profile was produced for each water source. At 119 ng/L pyriproxyfen (~25% effect concentration) for male neonate production, as expected, the Doublesex1 gene was up-regulated. In descending order, gene expression patterns were most discernable with respect to pyriproxyfen exposure status, season of stormwater sample collection, and wetland quality, as indicated by the index of biological integrity. However, the biological implications of the affected genes were not broadly clear given limited genome resources for invertebrates. Our study provides support for the utility of short-term whole-organism transcriptomic testing in D. magna to discern sample type, but highlights the need for further work on invertebrate genomics.
