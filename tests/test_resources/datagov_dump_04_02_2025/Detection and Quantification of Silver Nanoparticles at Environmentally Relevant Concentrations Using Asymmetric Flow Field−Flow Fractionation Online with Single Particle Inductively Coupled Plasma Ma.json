    "notes": "The presence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in aquatic environments could potentially cause adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health.  However, current understanding of the environmental fate and transport of AgNPs is still limited because their properties in complex environmental samples cannot be accurately determined.  In this study, the feasibility of using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) connected online with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICPMS) to detect and quantify AgNPs at environmentally relevant concentrations was investigated.  The AF4 channel had a thickness of 350 \u00b5m and its accumulation wall was a 10 kDa regenerated cellulose membrane.  A 0.02 % FL-70 surfactant solution was used as an AF4 carrier.  With 1.2 mL/min AF4 cross flow rate, 1.5 mL/min AF4 channel flow rate, and 5 ms spICPMS dwell time, the AF4\u2013spICPMS can detect and quantify 40 \u2013 80 nm AgNPs, as well as Ag-SiO2 nanoparticles (51.0 nm diameter Ag core and 21.6 nm SiO2 shell), with good recovery within 30 min.  This system was not only effective in differentiating and quantifying different types of AgNPs with similar hydrodynamic diameters, such as in mixtures containing Ag-SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles and 40 \u2013 80 nm AgNPs, but also suitable for differentiating between 40 nm AgNPs and elevated dissolved Ag content.  The study results indicate that AF4\u2013spICPMS is capable of detecting and quantifying AgNPs and other engineered metal- nanomaterials in environmental samples.  Nevertheless, further studies are needed before AF4\u2013spICPMS can become a routine analytical technique. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nHuynh, K.A., E. Siska, E.
