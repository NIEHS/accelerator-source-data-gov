    "notes": "A cross-sectional design was used where 86 residents of East Liverpool, Ohio, 100 residents from Marietta, Ohio and 90 residents from Mount Vernon, Ohio were recruited and participated in the study. The Marietta/Mount Vernon data collection took place in August, 2009 as this was the original study location. Marietta was an air manganese (air-Mn) exposed community and Mt. Vernon was a comparison community believed to have little or no air-Mn exposure. After receiving additional funding and approvals, East Liverpool was added and data collection occurred in November, 2011 using identical study protocols to the Marietta/Mount Vernon study with the exception of additional specimen collections of hair and toenails (only collected in East Liverpool). All participants underwent a neuropsychological battery of tests of mood, motor and cognitive function. A comprehensive health questionnaire was administered inquiring about sociodemographics, symptoms, diagnosed illnesses, medication use, health habits, work history, and dietary consumption (used to compute dietary intake of Mn and Fe). Additionally, the study included data acquisition on air monitoring and modeling, biomarkers, and health. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access.
