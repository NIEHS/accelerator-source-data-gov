    "notes": "The SAE International has published Aerospace Information Report (AIR) 6241 which outlined\nthe design and operation of a standardized measurement system for measuring non-volatile\nparticulate matter (nvPM) mass and number emissions from commercial aircraft engines. Prior\nto this research, evaluation of this system by various investigators revealed differences in nvPM mass emissions measurement on the order of 15\u201330% both within a single sampling system and\nbetween two systems operating in parallel and measuring nvPM mass emissions from the same\nsource. To investigate this issue, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with\nthe U. S. Air Force\u2019s Arnold Engineering Development Complex initiated the VAriable Response In\nAircraft nvPM Testing (VARIAnT) research program to compare nvPM measurements within and\nbetween AIR-compliant sampling systems used for measuring combustion aerosols generated both\nby a 5201 Mini-CAST soot generator and a J85-GE-5 turbojet engine burning multiple fuels. The\nVARIAnT research program has conducted four test campaigns to date. The first campaign\n(VARIAnT 1) compared two essentially identical commercial versions of the sampling system\nwhile the second campaign (VARIAnT 2) compared a commercial system to the custom-designed\nMissouri University of Science and Technology\u2019s North American Reference System (NARS) built\nto the same specifications. Comparisons of nvPM particle mass (i.e., black carbon), number, and\nsize were conducted in both campaigns. Additionally, the sensitivity to variation in system\noperational parameters was evaluated in VARIAnT 1. Results from both campaigns revealed\nagreement of about 12% between the two sampling systems, irrespective of manufacturer, in all\naspects except for black carbon determination. The major source of measurement differences\n(20\u201370%) was due to low BC mass measurements made by the Artium Technologies LII-300 as\ncompared to the AVL 483 Micro-Soot Sensor, the Aerodyne Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift (CAPS\nPMSSA) monitor, and the thermal-optical reference method for elemental carbon (EC) determination, which was used as the BC reference.
