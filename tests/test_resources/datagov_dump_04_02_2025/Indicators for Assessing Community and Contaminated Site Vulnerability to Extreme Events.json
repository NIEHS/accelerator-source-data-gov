    "notes": "The indicators (non-EPA owned, yet described in the Handbook and Manuscript) represent: 1) potential exposures due to extreme events (heat, floods, drought, and wildfire), 2) specific sources of contaminant releases (the different types of sites/waste facilities), 3) contaminant fate and transport (through water and wind), and 4) population sensitivity characteristics (demographics, socioeconomic conditions, existing health conditions) that indicate which individuals in the community may be impacted more by extreme events. The geospatial indicator data layers are at the Block Group level (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022), and each Block Group is considered to be a \u201ccommunity\u201d. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: The indicator data are from external co-authors collected solely from coauthor resources. The indicator data were all generated using publicly available data sources, as documented in the External Review Draft of Handbook (research product attached). It can be accessed through the following means: This data can be accessed by contacting the external lead author on the Handbook and Manuscript (Dr. Paramita Sinha, RTI), who can provide all of the indicator data layers and associated metadata documentation. Format: The indicator data are from external co-authors collected solely from co-author resources. The format of the indicator data are geospatial data layers (e.g., Shapefiles, NetCDFs) with daily/hourly temporal resolution and Census Block Group level spatial resolution. There are over 250 individual geospatial data files which would be too large to upload and store. The data are already available from public data sources, as documented in the External Review Draft of Handbook. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publications:\nSinha, P., R. Truesdale, M. Fry, and S. Julius. Handbook on Indicators of Community Vulnerability to Extreme Events: Considering Sites and Waste Management Facilities.
