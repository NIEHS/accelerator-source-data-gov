    "notes": "This is a summary of mercury (Hg) data from the Lahontan spillway area of the Carson River Basin.  USBR provided an information overview and reference source on mercury (Hg) in soils for water resources managers and researchers working in the Carson River Basin. \n\nThese data and the data tables provide results of the Lahontan spillway area, focused on the wetlands used by recreationalists and hunters, in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health exposure pathways. The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada. Runoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.  The elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the closed terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink.\n\nThis area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow. When Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink. This data was collected to help achieve goals set by the CWA that requires individual States to identify impaired water bodies and create enforceable WQ objectives to protect surface water quality within State bounds (CWA Sections 303d and 305 b).  These objectives were to focus on priority toxic pollutants, pursuant to CWA Section 307a. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI, for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  ",
