    "notes": "A tracer breakthrough curve (BTC) for each sampling station is the ultimate goal of every quantitative hydrologic tracing study, and dataset size can critically affect the BTC. Groundwater-tracing data obtained using in situ automatic sampling or detection devices may result in very high-density data sets. Data-dense tracer BTCs obtained using in situ devices and stored in dataloggers can result in visually cluttered overlapping data points. The relatively large amounts of data detected by high-frequency settings available on in situ devices and stored in dataloggers ensure that important tracer BTC features, such as data peaks, are not missed. Alternatively, such dense datasets can also be difficult to interpret. Even more difficult, is the application of such dense data sets in solute-transport models that may not be able to adequately reproduce tracer BTC shapes due to the overwhelming mass of data. One solution to the difficulties associated with analyzing, interpreting, and modeling dense data sets is the selective removal of blocks of the data from the total dataset. Although it is possible to arrange to skip blocks of tracer BTC data in a periodic sense (data decimation) so as to lessen the size and density of the dataset, skipping or deleting blocks of data also may result in missing the important features that the high-frequency detection setting efforts were intended to detect. Rather than removing, reducing, or reformulating data overlap, signal filtering and smoothing may be utilized but\nsmoothing errors (e.g., averaging errors, outliers, and potential time shifts) need to be considered. Appropriate probability distributions to tracer BTCs may be used to describe typical tracer BTC shapes, which usually include long tails. Recognizing appropriate probability distributions applicable to tracer BTCs can help in understanding some aspects of the tracer migration. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publications:\nField, M.
