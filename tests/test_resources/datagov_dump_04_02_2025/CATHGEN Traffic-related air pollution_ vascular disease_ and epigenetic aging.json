    "notes": "The data contains location information, DNA methylation (transformed into epigenetic aging biomakers), dates of examination, demographics, disease diagnoses, and traffic-related air pollution exposures. It is stored as a series of data frames suitable for use in the R programming language. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access. Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. It can be accessed through the following means: This data can be accessed by contacting Dr. Cavin Ward-Caviness and describing your needs for the analysis, completing the necessary ethics trainings, and gaining approval on the appropriate IRB applications as well as by the CATHGEN Steering Committee.
