    "notes": "In this manuscript EPA researchers used high resolution (1x1 km) modeled air quality data from a model built by Harvard collaborators to estimate the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and the occurrence of 30-day readmissions in a heart failure population. The heart failure population was taken from patients presenting to a University of North Carolina Healthcare System (UNCHCS) affiliated hospital or clinic that reported electronic health records to the Carolina Data Warehouse for Health (CDW-H). A description of the variables used in this analysis are available in the data dictionary (L:/PRIV/EPHD_CRB/Cavin/CARES/Data Dictonaries/HF short term PM25 and readmissions data dictionary.xlsx) associated with this manuscript. Analysis code is available in L:/PRIV/EPHD_CRB/Cavin/CARES/Project Analytic Code/Lauren Wyatt/DailyPM_HF_readmission. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: Dataset is PII in the form of electronic health records. It can be accessed through the following means: Data can be accessed with an approved IRB.
