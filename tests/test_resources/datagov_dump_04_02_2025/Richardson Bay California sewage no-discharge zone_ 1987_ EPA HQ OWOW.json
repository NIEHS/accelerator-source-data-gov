On May 2, 2001, the United States Coast Guard amended the chart carriage regulations to permit government vessels to use electronic charting and navigation systems in lieu of paper charts.\\n\\n2. On August 15, 2002, the United States Coast Guard issued a statement of policy to bring its regulations into agreement with SOLAS Chapter V (as amended by the changes taking effect July 1, 2002). The policy statement said that, if a ship has an approved ECDIS installed according to SOLAS, Chapter V, the ECDIS will be considered as meeting the ship's nautical chart carriage regulations. The ships that are affected are:\\n\\na. U.S.-flagged ships of 150 or more gross tons that engage on international voyages.\\n\\nb. U.S.-flagged ships certificated solely for service on the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.\\n\\nc. Foreign-flag ships to which SOLAS, Chapter V, applies that are operating on the navigable waters of the United States. \\n\\nThis policy is not applicable to U.S.-flag ships engaged only on domestic voyages. These ships must continue to comply with existing navigation equipment requirements until the chart carriage regulations are formally amended.\\n\\nThe NOAA ENC\\u00ae files available from this site are updated for Notices to Mariners on at least a monthly basis. Users are encouraged to check the site frequently and download the latest versions of the files. Updates are currently available as incremental updates (also called ENC Revision or \\\"ER\\\" files).\\n\\nCopying, reproduction of the NOAA ENC\\u00aes to any other server or location for further reproduction or redistribution is discouraged unless the following guidelines are followed: 1) the NOAA ENC\\u00aes and supplementary files including the CATALOG.031 and README.TXT are included in their entirety, 2) this disclaimer is displayed to and accepted by anyone who accesses the NOAA ENC\\u00aes, and 3) a reference to this Web site is included so that anyone accessing the NOAA ENC\\u00aes is advised of where they originated. \\n\\nIf these NOAA ENC\\u00aes are incorporated into any other product in a form other than as provided by NOAA, the producer of that product assumes full liability and must adhere to conditions 2 and 3 described in the paragraph above concerning copying or reproduction.\\n\\nList of Datasets In This Exchange Set:\\n\\nChart|Title|Edition|Update Application Date|Update|Issue Date|Cell Name\\n\\n18749|San Pedro Bay;Anaheim Bay Huntington Harbor|42|2018-10-23|0|2018-10-23|US5CA61M\\n\\nTotal Number = 1\"]"
