    "notes": "The efficiency of simulated at-sea surface oil burns (in situ burns, ISB) was determined while testing varied boom configurations and air-assist nozzles to improve combustion. Tests were conducted in a 14.3 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m tank under both calm and wave-action conditions. Emissions and residual uncombusted oil were sampled to characterize the effect of variations in boom length/width ratios, injection air, and presence or absence of waves. Tests were done with 30 L of Alaska North Slope oil within an outdoor, above ground, fresh water, 63 m3 tank equipped with wave actuators and baffles. The combustion plume was sampled for emissions using a crane-suspended instrument system. Combustion efficiencies based on unburned carbon in the plume emissions ranged from 85% to 93%. Efficiencies based on oil mass loss ranged from 89% to 99% but were not predicted by changes in boom ratio, air injection, or the presence of waves. A four-fold variation in PM2.5 emission factors was observed from the test conditions and the most effective burns in terms of reduced emissions were those that had high length to width boom ratios resulting in higher flame front surface area exposure to ambient air. The presence of added injection air near the oil/water/flame interface had no statistical effect on the combustion efficiency, suggesting that added oxygen and air-induced turbulence at the oil/flame interface was not limiting the combustion rate. The presence of waves had a limited detrimental effect on combustion emissions, possibly caused by enhancing heat loss from the burning oil to the water below. Post-burn, residual oil samples were collected and analyzed to show that the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration in the residuals decreased as the oil mass loss increased. The amount of oil mass lost was not related to any combustion efficiency parameters or pollutant levels. However, TPH in residues were significantly lower at higher boom ratios in the control and air plus waves tests. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nAurell, J., A.
