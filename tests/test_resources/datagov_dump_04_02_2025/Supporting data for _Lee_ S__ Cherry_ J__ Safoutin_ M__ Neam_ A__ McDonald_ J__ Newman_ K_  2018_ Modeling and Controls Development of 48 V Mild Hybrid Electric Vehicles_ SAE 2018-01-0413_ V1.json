    "notes": "The purpose of this work was to develop a 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV) model for drive cycle simulation using the EPA Advanced Light-Duty Powertrain and Hybrid Analysis tool (ALPHA).  The work included controls development, component and vehicle modeling , and model validation for simulations of a vehicle with a 48 V Belt Integrated Starter Generator (BISG) MHEV system.  An initial model design was also developed for a 48 V inline on-axis P2-configuration MHEV and will be validated as part of future work. Both MHEV configurations were developed into sub-models using a MATLAB/Simulink/Stateflow tool.  The sub-models have subsequently been integrated into EPA\u2019s ALPHA vehicle model.  Initial sub-model development and validation was conducted using the commercially-available Gamma Technology GT-DRIVE vehicle simulation model. The mild hybrid electric vehicle model was validated using vehicle data obtained from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) chassis dynamometer tests of a 2013 Chevrolet Malibu Eco 115 V 15 kW BISG mild hybrid electric vehicle. The simulated fuel economy, engine torque/speed, motor torque/speed, engine on-off controls, battery voltage, current, and State of Charge (SOC) were all in good agreement with the vehicle test data on a number of drive schedules. The developed 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicle model can be used to estimate the GHG emissions and fuel economy of 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicles over the EPA regulatory drive cycles and to estimate off-cycle GHG emissions, real-world GHG emissions, and vehicle energy flows. The 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicle model will be further validated with additional 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicle test data in the future as more vehicle models become available. EPA has included 48 V BISG mild hybrid electric vehicle technology in its assessment of CO2-reducing technologies available for compliance with U.S. GHG standards. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLee, S., M.
