    "notes": "Gene expression data from the Fluidigm qRT-PCR arrays was analyzed in R (v3.6.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2019). Prior to processing through the tcpl package, each qRT-PCR primer set was annotated as an individual assay endpoint (aeid) for analyses. For each plate, well types were designated for test compound wells (t), positive controls (c), (that is phenobarbital) and neutral controls (n, DMSO). Fold-change in the number of amplification cycles needed to pass the background threshold (Ct) for 96 transcripts to (ftp://newftp.epa.gov/COMPTOX/CCTE_Publication_Data/CCED_Publication_Data/Wambaugh/ToxCast_LTEA, file LTEA_Level2_20191119.zip) were normalized to the geometric mean of three housekeeping genes (ACTB, GAPDH, POLR2A) to generate \u0394Ct values (cval). Prior to calculating the response values (rval), or \u0394\u0394Ct, for each transcript (n = 96) per well, the baseline value (bval), the plate-wise median of the neutral control wells, was generated for each plate (the normalization process is described in detail in supplemental file SupFile4-DeltaCTCalculation.docx). The bval was subtracted from the cval to yield the rval or log2 Fold Change per transcript. \n\nGene expression data from the Fluidigm qRT-PCR arrays was analyzed in R (v3.6.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2019).

Cell morphology images were acquired for each well/plate with an Essen IncuCyte\u2122 FLR automated phase-contrast microscope located inside a tissue culture incubator. Six 96-well culture plates were loaded into the instrument and imaged for an elapsed time (~24 minutes). The IncuCyte\u2122 software was used for image capturing and export of images in JPEG format. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nFranzosa, J., J. Bonzo, J. Jack, N.C.
