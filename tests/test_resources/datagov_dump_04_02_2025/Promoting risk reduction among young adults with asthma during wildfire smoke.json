    "notes": "Poor air quality (AQ) from wildfire smoke is associated with increased asthma attacks and emergency department visits. Young adults are less likely to adhere to AQ alerts than older adults. \nThis study utilized data collected as part of a 2020 pilot study testing two smartphone application (app) interventions in young adults with asthma compared to a control group.\nNIH R21 1R21NR019071-01 (PI: Postma, Julie M) 4/1/2020-3/31/2022 Promoting Risk\nReduction Among Young Adults with Asthma During Wild\fre Smoke Events The goal of\nthis proposal was to assess the feasibility of the `Smoke Sense,' an EPA-developed smart\nphone air quality application (app), to positively impact health outcomes among young\nadults with asthma. This study is a clinical intervention.
