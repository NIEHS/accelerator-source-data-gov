    "notes": "Short time interval comparisons of low cost sensor response and corresponding Federal Reference or Federal Equivalent Monitors at an NCOR site located in proximity to Atlanta, Georgia. Portions of this dataset are inaccessible because: The data were integrated using R.  Currently there is no means of reporting \"R: database in the science hub. Data are still being reviewed as part of the journal publication process.  Release prior to journal acceptance could result in external parties inappropriately using the data (including sensor manufacturers who might use such data without a full understanding of its meaning). They can be accessed through the following means: Direct transfer from the Principal Investigator upon journal publication. Format: The dataset was created in R and represents an extensive short time resolution of thousands of lines of air quality measurements.  In addition, the data have been integrated into a manuscript which has yet to be published.  The manuscript was cleared  through STICs but has not yet rec'd journal based peer review acceptance. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nJiao, W., G. Hagler, R.
