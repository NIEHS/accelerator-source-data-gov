    "notes": "This repository contains the data supporting the manuscript \"A Generic Scenario Analysis of End-of-Life Plastic Management: Chemical Additives\" (to be) submitted to the Energy and Environmental Science Journal https://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/ee#!recentarticles&adv\nThis repository contains Excel spreadsheets used to calculate material flow throughout the plastics life cycle, with a strong emphasis on chemical additives in the end-of-life stages. Three major scenarios were presented in the manuscript: 1) mechanical recycling (existing recycling infrastructure), 2) implementing chemical recycling to the existing plastics recycling, and 3) extracting chemical additives before the manufacturing stage.\nUsers would primarily modify values on the yellow tab \"US 2018 Facts - Sensitivity\". Values highlighted in yellow may be changed for sensitivity analysis purposes. Please note that the values shown for MSW generated, recycled, incinerated, landfilled, composted, imported, exported, re-exported, and other categories in this tab were based on 2018 data. Analysis for other years can be made possible with a replicate version of this spreadsheet and the necessary data to replace those of 2018.\nMost of the tabs, especially those that contain \"Stream # - Description\", do not require user interaction. They are intermediate calculations that change according to the user inputs. It is available for the user to see so that the calculation/method is transparent. The major results of these individual stream tabs are ultimately compiled into one summary tab. All streams throughout the plastics life cycle, for each respective scenario (1, 2, and 3), are shown in the \"US Mat Flow Analysis 2018\" tab. For each stream, we accounted the approximate mass of plastics found in MSW, additives that may be present, and non-plastics. Each spreadsheet contains a representative diagram that matches the stream label. This illustration is placed to aid the user with understanding the connection between each stage in the plastics' life cycle.\nFor example, the Scenario 1 spreadsheet uniquely contains Material Flow Analysis Summary, in addition to the LCI. In the \"Material Flow Analysis Summary\" tab, we represented the input, output, releases, exposures, and greenhouse gas emissions based on the amount of materials inputted into a specific stage in the plastics life cycle.\nThe \"Life Cycle Inventory\" tab contributes additional calculations to estimate land, air, and water releases.\nFigures and Data - A gs analysis on eol plastic management\nThis word document contains the raw data used to create all the figures in the main manuscript. The major references used to obtain the data are also included where appropriate.",
