    "notes": "This dataset contains: California Dairies, Food Processing Facilities, Wastewater treatment facilities with digesters (AZ, NV, HI, CA), California Landfills, California Organic Collection Programs, California Fat/Oil/Grease Collection Sites, Fat/Oil/Grease Haulers (AZ, NV, CA). List of dairies located in California that do not use anaerobic digesters to produce biogas, and estimates of how much biogas could be produced if these dairies were to use anaerobic digesters to manage dairy waste. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board provided EPA Region 9 with herd size data by from their 2005 General Waste Discharge annual report (contact person at the Water Quality Control Board: Doug Patterson, Doug.Patteson@waterboards.ca.gov). List of food processing facilities (in NV, AZ, CA, HI) producing waste that could be used for co-digestion at wastewater treatment facilities and other entities with anaerobic digesters. The facilities included were based on a list of businesses classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as food manufacturing businesses. Dunn and Bradstreet compiled the list in 2010 per the request by the EPA. List of Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF) with anaerobic digesters in Arizona. The list of facilities was obtained from the annual biosolids report required under 40 CFR 503 (Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge) for WWTF with influent flows over 1 million gallons per day. Original data set was based on 2004 reporting, which was the last year Arizona WWTFs were required to report to the EPA, but was partially updated based on direct communication between EPA Region 9\u2019s Sustainable Infrastructure program and some of the WWTFs. List of Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTFs) with anaerobic digesters (in NV, HI). The list of facilities was obtained from the annual biosolids report required under 40 CFR 503 (Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge) for WWTFs with influent flows over 1 million gallons per day. The data used by the Waste to Biogas Mapping tool can and have been updated based on request through a web interface and by the EPA Region 9 Sustainable Infrastructure program. California Organic Collection Programs: List of organic collection programs in California that have the potential to provide waste for co-digestion at Wastewater Treatment Facilities and other entities that use anaerobic digesters. A study conducted by New Found Lands Institute in 2008 with a grant provided by EPA Region 9 was the source of the information about organic collection programs. List of Fat, Oil, and Grease (FOG) hauling and rendering companies serving locations in the State of California and that have the potential to provide FOG for co-digestion at Wastewater Treatment Facilities and other entities that use anaerobic digesters. EPA Region 9\u2019s Sustainable Infrastructure program obtained the data from the CalFOG website in 2009. The list of haulers on the CalFOG website can be found here: http://www.calfog.org/Hauler.html. Updates to the CalFOG website are not automatically reflected in the Waste to Biogas Mapping Tool. The data used by the Waste to Biogas Mapping tool can and have been updated based on request through a web interface and by the EPA Region 9 Sustainable Infrastructure program. List of Fat, Oil, and Grease (FOG) hauling companies serving locations in the State of Arizona and that have the potential to provide FOG for co-digestion at Wastewater Treatment Facilities and other entities that use anaerobic digesters. EPA Region 9\u2019s Sustainable Infrastructure program obtained the data from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality in 2009 (contact: Barbara M. Waterbury, Waterbury.Barbara@azdeq.gov and Steven Schoen,) steven.schoen@phoenix.gov).
