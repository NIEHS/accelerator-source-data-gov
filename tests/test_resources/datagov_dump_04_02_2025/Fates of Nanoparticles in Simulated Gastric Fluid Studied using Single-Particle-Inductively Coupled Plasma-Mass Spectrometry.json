    "notes": "This study adds to the growing knowledge of the fates of ENPs under conditions that simulate the human stomach. The fates of different nanoparticles after exposure to a simulated human digestion system is highly relevant to understand the impact of ENPs overall as they become more integrated into daily life, potentially resulting in increased exposures. Various factors such as species, size, the concentration of ingested ENPs, and body temperature on the fates of nanoparticles in the human digestion system proved to be varied and complex. This research highlights the need for a better understanding of nanomaterials' properties in the digestive system under other physiologically relevant conditions. This work contributes to an improved understanding of the fates of ENPs in gastric fluid, which gives insights into the gastrointestinal uptake of these ENPs before they enter into the blood circulation and organ systems. It is especially crucial for nanoparticles not completely solubilized in the digestive system's physiological contact time because these ENPs will enter into the other body systems and potentially circulate through the body as particulates. Using this study framework, sequentially studying in other tissues, especially for those ENPs not dissolved in SGF, including Ag-NPs, Au-NPs, and CeO\u00ac2\u2013NPs, would be valuable to evaluate the potential risk of ENPs to human health. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: The research continued, additional papers could be published from this data set. It can be accessed through the following means: Data will be placed in EPA file server. Format: Data is on spreadsheet, which includes dissolution rate of engineered nanoparticles of different particle size in simulated gastric fluid. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nHe, X., H.
