    "notes": "Data describe the effects of metal oxide nanoparticles on total spikes and active electrodes after exposure to various concentrations for 1, 24 and 48 hrs, or after treatment with bicuculline. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: Each raw file contains at least 1 hour of recording time and is approximately 50 GB or larger. They cannot be uploaded due to file size. It can be accessed through the following means: Raw files are analyzed using scripts written in R-programming language and outputs from R included the graphs used in the publication. Summaries of the data, R-scripts and summary outputs from the R-analysis are located at the following locations: L:\\Lab\\NHEERL_MEA\\Crooks\\MEA_MetalOxides\r\n          This directory and its sub-directory contains over 30 output files from the R-script analysis including xcell files summarizing the parameters of different statistical models and visualizations of the data in the form of tiff files.\r\nL:\\Lab\\NHEERL_MEA\\nanoparticles\\Crooks MEA\\final analysis\r\n     This directory and its sub-directories include R-scripts used for analysis as well as folders with R-outputs summarizing statistics for different Fixed-dose trend, fixed interaction and fixed square root models used for analysis. There are over 50 files in this directory. Format: Raw data are derived from Axion Biosystems Maestro system using Axis 1.9 or later software. Data are saved as \"*.raw\" in a proprietary format on DROBO devices in the Shafer lab. The DROBO devices consist of five 2TB or larger hard drives and allows for self backing of files. Files are stored in folders based on the date the cell culture used for a particular experiment was made, and in subfolders for each experiment date for that culture. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nStrickland, J., W. Lefew , J. Crooks , D. Hall, J. Ortenzio, K. Dreher , and T. Shafer. In vitro screening of metal oxide nanoparticles for effects on neural function using cortical networks on microelectrode arrays.
