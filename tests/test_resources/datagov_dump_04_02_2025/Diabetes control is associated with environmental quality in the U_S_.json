    "notes": "Population-based county-level estimates for prevalence of DC were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for the years 2004-2012 (16). DC prevalence rate was defined as the propor-tion of people within a county who had previously been diagnosed with diabetes (high fasting plasma glu-cose \uf0b3126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of \uf0b36.5%, or diabetes diagnosis) but do not currently have high fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c for the period 2004-2012. DC prevalence estimates were calculated using a two-stage approach. The first stage used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to predict high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (\u2265126 mg/dL) and/or HbA1C levels (\u22656.5% [48 mmol/mol]) based on self-reported demographic and behavioral characteristics (16). This model was then applied to Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to impute high FPG and/or HbA1C status for each BRFSS respondent (16). The second stage used the imputed BRFSS data to fit a series of small area models, which were used to predict county-level prevalence of diabetes-related outcomes, including DC (16).\nThe EQI was constructed for 2006-2010 for all US counties and is composed of five domains (air, water, built, land, and sociodemographic), each composed of variables to represent the environmental quality of that domain. Domain-specific EQIs were developed using principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce these variables within each domain while the overall EQI was constructed from a second PCA from these individual domains (L. C. Messer et al., 2014). To account for differences in environment across rural and urban counties, the overall and domain-specific EQIs were stratified by rural urban continuum codes (RUCCs) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).\nResults are reported as prevalence rate differences (PRD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the highest quintile/worst environmental quality to the lowest quintile/best environmental quality expo-sure metrics. PRDs are representative of the entire period of interest, 2004-2012. Due to availability of DC data and covariate data, not all counties were captured, however, the majority, 3134 of 3142 were utilized in the analysis.
