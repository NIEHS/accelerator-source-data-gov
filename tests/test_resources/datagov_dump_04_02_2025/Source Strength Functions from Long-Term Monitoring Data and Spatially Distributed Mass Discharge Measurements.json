    "notes": "Source strength functions (SSF), defined as contaminant mass discharge or flux-averaged concentration from dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones as a function of time, provide a quantitative model of DNAPL source-zone behavior.  Such information is useful for making site management decisions.  We investigate the use of historic data collected during long-term monitoring (LTM) activities at a site in Rhode Island to predict the SSF based on temporal mass discharge measurements at a fixed location, as well as SSF estimation using mass discharge measurements at a fixed time from three spatially distributed control planes.  Mass discharge based on LTM data decreased from ~300 g/day in 1996 to ~70 g/day in 2012 at a control plane downgradient of the suspected DNAPL source zone, and indicates an overall decline of ~80% in 16 years.  These measurements were compared to current mass discharge measurements across three spatially distributed control planes.  Results indicate that mass discharge increased in the downgradient direction, and was ~6 g/day, ~37 g/day, and ~400 g/day at near, intermediate, and far distances from the suspected source zone, respectively.  This behavior was expected given the decreasing trend observed in the LTM data at a fixed location.  These two data sets were compared using travel time as a means to plot the data sets on a common axis.  The similarity between the two data sets gives greater confidence to the use of this combined data set for site-specific SSF estimation relative to either the sole use of LTM or spatially distributed data sets. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBrooks, M.C., A.L.
