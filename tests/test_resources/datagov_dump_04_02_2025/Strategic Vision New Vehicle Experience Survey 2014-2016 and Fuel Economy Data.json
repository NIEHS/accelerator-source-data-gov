The survey data is confidential business information (CBI). These data were matched at the make-model level of specificity.\n\nThe data includes over 800,000 survey responses regarding consumer characteristics, vehicle attributes, consumer satisfaction, and the consumer purchase process plus fuel economy information for purchased and considered vehicles.
