The zone must also be in the FL Keys Nat\u2019l Marine Sanctuary.\nDue to the nature of the source data, merging these layers required a conversion of the Sanctuary boundary to a linear feature.  The merged output (linear) then had to be converted to polygon features to represent the NDZ.\nThe NDZ at this stage, which is meant to solely cover water, contained land (islands and some mainland).  The land features were erased from the NDZ feature in 2 steps.  First, the Florida Keys, as represented by the \u2018U.S. States\u2019 layer, were erased from the NDZ feature.  Since the Florida Keys are very generalized in the \u2018U.S. States\u2019 layer (only about 500 of the 1700+ FL Keys are represented), an additional erase step was performed using the islands depicted in the Sanctuary layer.*\n*FL Keys Nat\u2019l Marine Sanctuary GIS layer represents water area, not land (islands).  To use this data to erase land from the Final NDZ Layer, it was first processed to convert the holes in the data to features.  This was done by creating a \u2018box\u2019 feature around the FKNMS, then erasing the FKNMS feature from it."
