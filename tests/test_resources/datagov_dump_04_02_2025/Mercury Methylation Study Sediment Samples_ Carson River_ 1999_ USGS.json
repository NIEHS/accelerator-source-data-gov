    "notes": "USGS conducted preliminary assays on aged (3 mo.) surface sediment (0-4 cm) collected from 13 sites during October 1998 in order to decipher general spatial trends in Hg-speciation, microbiology and relevant biogeochemistry. During the second field campaign sample processing and incubations were conducted at ambient temperature within hours of sediment collection to provide a more accurate measure of in-situ process rates and analyte concentrations. The third field sampling (October 1999), involving 14 sampling and was conducted with a similar approach as in June 1999. The latter two data sets provide a direct seasonal comparison (summer/fall, high/lo flow conditions) of Hg transformation dynamics in the CRS. Sediment depth profiles (0-16 cm) were investigated at four sites during June 1999 and at two of these four during October 1999. Eroding vertical bank material was sampled in the Hg-contaminated Fort Churchill region during both 1999 dates. Laboratory experiments were conducted using sediment collected during the latter two sampling dates.\n\nThe study purpose sought to: a) identify important zones of net methylmercury (MeHg) production and consumption within the CRS, b) determine which environmental factors most strongly influence these processes and c) provide estimates of seasonal variability. Measurements were made of microbial Hg-transformations (via radiotracer) and in-situ Hg speciation (total mercury (Hgt), MeHg, and particle-associated acid-extractable Hg(II)). Acid extractable Hg(II) was used as a surrogate measure for the Hg(II) most readily available to bacteria for methylation. A novel Hg-biosensor technique was also used to assess bioavailable Hg(II) in pore-water. A suite of ancillary microbial processes and sediment geochemical parameters were also measured to more fully characterize each site, and to relate these measurements to observed Hg-transformation rates and Hg-speciation.\n\nThe EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",
